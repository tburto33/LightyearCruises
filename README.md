This is my final project to pass the Front End Web Developer course for Code Louisville. 
I decided to create a fun website that is a landing page for a fake company selling space cruises to see other planets in our solar system.  
Features:
- Mobile First Responsive
- Multi-Page Design
- Site and Forms based in Boostrap.
- Media Queries at vairous sizes to fix viewing content:
- Ham Menu, Carousel, Logo, and others.
- JS based around using forms to gather info to post, validate, and use in modal.
